Rearranged the UI a little bit.

Click "Total" to calculate total price.

-update 3/27-
Spend an extra hour adding a menu so that it looks more like a real ordering app instead of manually inputed food. Click on pictures then on "Add" button to add an item.

I left the input fields editable for you to test API functionality.

Hardcoded the menu and some string processing process.
